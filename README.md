Frontend library written from scratch with Typescript. Aims to provide declarative DOM/data reactivity with features similar to those in Vue.js. 

Created mainly for educational purposes, I would recommend using React/Angular/Vue/Svelte/similar instead. However this does have some strengths, you can easily audit the code and your bundle size will be small (zero runtime dependencies). Instructional site at jeffreyyang3.github.io/nnDemoPage
